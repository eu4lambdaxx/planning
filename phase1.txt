Some of the early game is inspired by Terry's 1495 run. Lots of brainstorming
and advices from Gnostek, esp. on Timurid dynasty, Mongolia integration, etc.
Revoke strat is mostly going to be the same as my original plan, but I will use
a catholic province as capital.

Revoke ~1460 notes:

Golden era:
- 5 vassals
- large city (30 dev cap)
- present on two continents
- humiliate

consider not doing 5 vassals, large city, or humiliate? Humiliate means I have
to sacrifise 40 WS early on, large city means I have to concentrate ~20 dev
early on (prefer to concentrate after moving cap to catholic province for easier
religion flip), and 5 vassals mean I have to setup some vassals...

I think large city is fine -- it's not that much dev, and I don't think Tengri
is a contender, it'll be catholic vs sunni.
Humiliate on Ming might be okay.
Vassal is... not sure. Preferably no? Maybe a few is still useful for lambda 2.

Dip rep:
- +1 (25 yrs) Generic mission (two allies w/ 150 opinion, could be easily done when securing
  HRE election)
- +1 (10 yrs) Tribal estate agenda to subjugate someone
- +1 Diplo rep advisor
- +2 Diplo ideas
- +1 (10 yrs) Diplo rep idea group event (5 year pulse)

Manchu formation before revoke??
- Gives another cycle of consolidating for higher catholic dev
- Gives 2 dip rep if Korea is fully conquered
- Need to get Defeat the Rus before
- Need to move cap again after forming (more adm spent)
- Need to conquer more asian stuff

Oirat missions:
- Claim the khanate (core Mongolia's capital)
- Unite the mongols (own 5 provinces of Mongol/Korchin/Khalkha/Oirat)
  - Need to dow Korchin for the 5 Korchin provinces
  - Need to grab 3 Mongolian provinces (from Mongolia)
- Restore rule on the steppe (own 30 provinces in Central asia + Ryn and Khiva)
- Subjugate the Tatars (own 15 provinces in Pontic Steppe region)
- Defeat the Rus (own 30 provinces in Russia/Ruthenia and own Kiev + Moskva)

Dealing with Mongolia:
25 rel 50 vassal 20 transfer trade 25 rm 5 consort ties 25 gift
~40 extra improv relation needed (45 if no consort ties) to begin annexation
15 from subsidies if done ~10 months in advance. Costs roughly 5 duc/mo
~May 1446 with advisor + trade policy
Feed Solon Mongolian land after beginning annexation to minimize annexation
cost. Make sure to leave 3 Mongolian culture provinces + Ih Huree for mission
tree.
What if you dow Korchin?
- Unsieging a province gives 25 opinion (ticks down by 1/yr, does not stack)
- Fighting a battle in Mongolia land gives 10 opinion (^)
- Taking Mongolian core from Korchin loses 20 opinion
Overall, +15 opinion diff, which saves ~7 months. Mongolia annexation can start
around Oct 1445 ideally. Can adjust a bit by not taking Mongolian cores or
subsidizing. Can also enforce dynasty (25 LD for 15 opinion). Make sure you
don't raze any Mongolian cores until you begin integration.

Manchu:
- 20 Jurchen cores (2 of them have to be Girin and Huncun) to form
- Dominate Rival Jurchens (core Girin + Huncun + Ilan Hala + Hulan)
- Unite the Jurchen tribes (own 25 Manchurian region provinces)
- Bypass the Great Wall (own Beijing and Shenyang)
- The Eight Banners (have 8 banners -- make sure you do not immediately give -banner priv)
- Invade Joseon (own all Korea region provinces)

Starting mercs:
- Buryat Band high siege for Korchin. Use for Solon + Manchuria + Ming
- Kazakh company high siege for Chagatai -> Uzbek. Mongol mercs OK, but more
  expensive. Use west

Route:

1444-11-11:
Placate + transfer trade hover to make Mongolia loyal. Build 2 infantry
Seize Barag from Mongolia, hire free company then Buryat band on Barag
Do ^ before estates since low CL malus will make them disloyal
Transfer trade Mongolia

Estates:
- GC + manpower + loyalty/influence agendas
- Sell land
- (don't seize, the 20% cav cost is more valuable than the penalty of 15% CL for
  a year or so until you do one peace deal)
- Call diet (need annex Mongolia diet? maybe not)

Merchants: Xian merchant establish communities, Siberia collect to Yumen collect
(set policy to siege ability during war with Chagatai)
Advisors: Adm is w.e, dip is imp rel, mil is morale
Missionnary: send to anything + missionary strength edict
Decisions: Yellow shamanism, no introduce vision quest
Adm focus
Rival Uzbek + Chagatai

Diplomats:
- Mongolia improve (takes 11 days to come back)
- Timurids improve
- Misc spynetwork

Consider getting Grand company before it's too big?

Korchin: dow + farm Mongolia opinion (see above notes)
Mongolia: integrate (see above notes)
Ming: need Esen Taishi to die with Timurid dynasty... Probably segment
Chagatai: If can't dec on Dec11, then he will recover. Can still get 100% WS w/o
Yarkand
Uzbek: Juicy
Timurids: Ruler needs to die and ind. war needs to fire before I get an RM. He
needs to have weak allies or allies I can easily kill (aka just Nogai...
Chagatai works too but idk if Timurids ever allies them). Great Horde/big
Indians are nono


War 1:
Dow Korchin (let them occupy Mongolian province first -- fight with free
company?)
- Don't move troops south, let Korchin think Southern Mongolia is safe.
- Should appear on Ju Ud around Jan? They will try to defend their country if
  you siege them, so don't siege until they finish Ju Ud siege.
Dow Chagatai (wipe Chagatai asap, don't siege Yarkand too much). They will run
west, so move troops accordingly to catch them in Qurqara Usu or Ili

Gift Mongolia before Feb 1445 (need 50+ ducats and not making deficit, which
could be hard with going super over FL)

Peace out both when Mongolia integration is ready. Don't raze Mongolian cores
until begin annexation.

Hire grand company here? Not sure. Can also hire some Chinese mercs around here.

War 2:
Dow Solon (feed Mongolia land)
Dow Haixi (feudalism)
Dow other Manchurians if appropriate. Maybe leave Jianzhou alone.
Dow Uzbek (don't wait for Mongolia integration -- just take and core the central
asian provinces w/o perma claim, w.e). Probably release Sibir vassal -- don't
bother coring

Dow Kazan + Nogai, dow Transoxiana if appropriate.
Should be able to dow Ming soon.

Savescum for:
1) Poland Lithuania PU (they should be separate)
2) Moldavia vassal (they should remain independent and therefore guaranteed by Poland)
3) Crimea Ottoman march (no thanks)
4) Austria Hungary PU
