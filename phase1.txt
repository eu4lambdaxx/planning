Some of the early game is inspired by Terry's 1495 run. Lots of brainstorming
and advices from Gnostek, esp. on Timurid dynasty, Mongolia integration, etc.
Revoke strat is mostly going to be the same as my original plan, but I will use
a catholic province as capital.

Revoke ~1460 notes:

Golden era:
- large city (30 dev cap)
- present on two continents
- humiliate

consider not doing 5 vassals, large city, or humiliate? Humiliate means I have
to sacrifise 40 WS early on, large city means I have to concentrate ~20 dev
early on (prefer to concentrate after moving cap to catholic province for easier
religion flip), and 5 vassals mean I have to setup some vassals...

I think large city is fine -- it's not that much dev, and I don't think Tengri
is a contender, it'll be catholic vs sunni.
Humiliate on Ming might be okay.
Vassal is... not sure. Preferably no? Maybe a few are still useful for v2.

Dip rep:
- +1 (25 yrs) Generic mission (two allies w/ 150 opinion, could be easily done when securing
  HRE election)
- +1 (10 yrs) Tribal estate agenda to subjugate someone
- +1 Diplo rep advisor
- +2 Diplo ideas
- +1 (10 yrs) Diplo rep idea group event (5 year pulse)

Manchu formation before revoke??
- Gives another cycle of consolidating for higher catholic dev
- Gives 2 dip rep if Korea is fully conquered
- Need to get Defeat the Rus before
- Need to move cap again after forming (more adm spent)
- Need to conquer more asian stuff

Oirat missions:
- Claim the khanate (core Mongolia's capital)
- Unite the mongols (own 5 provinces of Mongol/Korchin/Khalkha/Oirat)
  - Need to dow Korchin for the 5 Korchin provinces
  - Need to grab 3 Mongolian provinces (from Mongolia)
- Restore rule on the steppe (own 30 provinces in Central asia + Ryn and Khiva)
- Subjugate the Tatars (own 15 provinces in Pontic Steppe region)
- Defeat the Rus (own 30 provinces in Russia/Ruthenia and own Kiev + Moskva)

Dealing with Mongolia:
25 rel 50 vassal 20 transfer trade 25 rm 5 consort ties 25 gift
~40 extra improv relation needed (45 if no consort ties) to begin annexation
15 from subsidies if done ~10 months in advance. Costs roughly 5 duc/mo
~May 1446 with advisor + trade policy
Feed Solon Mongolian land after beginning annexation to minimize annexation
cost. Make sure to leave 3 Mongolian culture provinces + Ih Huree for mission
tree.
What if you dow Korchin?
- Unsieging a province gives 25 opinion (ticks down by 1/yr, does not stack)
- Fighting a battle in Mongolia land gives 10 opinion (^)
- Taking Mongolian core from Korchin loses 20 opinion
Overall, +15 opinion diff, which saves ~7 months. Mongolia annexation can start
around Oct 1445 ideally. Can adjust a bit by not taking Mongolian cores or
subsidizing. Can also enforce dynasty (25 LD for 15 opinion). Make sure you
don't raze any Mongolian cores until you begin integration.

Manchu:
- 20 Jurchen cores (2 of them have to be Girin and Huncun) to form
- Dominate Rival Jurchens (core Girin + Huncun + Ilan Hala + Hulan)
- Unite the Jurchen tribes (own 25 Manchurian region provinces)
- Bypass the Great Wall (own Beijing and Shenyang)
- The Eight Banners (have 8 banners -- make sure you do not immediately give -banner priv)
- Invade Joseon (own all Korea region provinces)

Starting mercs:
- Buryat Band high siege for Korchin. Use for Solon + Manchuria + Ming
- Kazakh company high siege for Chagatai -> Uzbek. Mongol mercs OK, but more
  expensive. Use west

Route:

1444-11-11:
Placate + transfer trade hover to make Mongolia loyal. Build 2 infantry
Seize Barag from Mongolia, hire free company then Buryat band on Barag
Do ^ before estates since low CL malus will make them disloyal
Transfer trade Mongolia

Estates:
- GC + manpower + loyalty/influence agendas
- Sell land
- (don't seize, the 20% cav cost is more valuable than the penalty of 15% CL for
  a year or so until you do one peace deal)
- Call diet (need annex Mongolia diet? maybe not)

Merchants: Xian merchant establish communities, Siberia collect to Yumen collect
(set policy to siege ability during war with Chagatai)
Advisors: Adm is w.e, dip is imp rel, mil is morale
Missionnary: send to anything + missionary strength edict
Decisions: Yellow shamanism, no introduce vision quest
Adm focus
Rival Uzbek + Chagatai

Diplomats:
- Mongolia improve (takes 11 days to come back)
- Timurids improve
- Misc spynetwork


War 1:
Dow Korchin (let them occupy Mongolian province first -- fight with free
company?)
- Don't move troops south, let Korchin think Southern Mongolia is safe.
- Should appear on Ju Ud around Jan? They will try to defend their country if
  you siege them, so don't siege until they finish Ju Ud siege.
Dow Chagatai (wipe Chagatai asap, don't siege Yarkand too much). They will run
west, so move troops accordingly to catch them in Qurqara Usu or Ili

Gift Mongolia before Feb 1445 (need 50+ ducats and not making deficit, which
<<<<<<< HEAD
could be hard with going super over FL. Can get a bit extra via exploit dev)

Before peacing both out, RM Mongolia for 25 rel. Peace -> return Barag (25
opinion) -> begin integrating Mongolia -> declare next set of wars.
Make sure you raze Mongol cores (taken from Korchin) after you begin annexation.

War 2:
Dow Uzbek + Solon. Priority is making sure Mongolia annexation finishes asap.
With proper pacing, you should only need 48 integration progress, which is
a bit over 1 year. 100% Solon and feed most of non-core Mongolian land (except 3 Mongol
culture provinces in South to connect + later mission). Seize the remaining
non-cores appropriately by placating/dev pushing cores.

Focus on Central asian provinces from Uzbek. Don't fixate on getting perma
claims from missions -- pacing is more important, and ideally Uzbek should be
~100%'d within a year.

-- at this point there isn't much incentive to be at peace, so exact order of
peace deals/new war decs don't matter much.

Dow (western front):
- Transoxiana (during ind. war)
  - Take Khiva + enough central asian provinces for mission. I would not border
    Timurids yet since Tim coalition is a bitch.
- Nogai
  - Again, central asian provinces
- Great Horde
  - Mission tree + border Ryazan
- Kazan
  - Border Muscovy
- Crimea
  - More pontic steppe provinces/full annex is possible with Crimea as war goal
    if they don't get lucky dev events (barely 100%)
- Muscovy/Lithuania/Novgorod/Tver/Ryazan
  - Goal is to get defeat the Rus. May need to snag Theodoro for an extra Pontic
    steppe province. Worst case might even need Genoa?? Not sure how long that
    war will be. Before peacing out Muscovy, make sure Ryazan is full annexed
    so you can take Moscow + a snake to Novgorod. Alternatively approach Muscovy
    with diplo6 for WS red, but idk how feasible that is timing wise.
  - Odoyev could be used for truce reset against Lith + Muscovy, but instead
    just take more provinces from them (no time to wait 5 year white peace
    truce). Consider trucebreaking them instead if necessary, although I don't
    think it's advisable given that they mainly hold orthodox provinces.
- Poland
  - Ideally approach with diplo + defeat the Rus. Moldavia can be used to take
    more provinces.
- Hungary
  - _Maybe_ consider bordering Cilli after? Not sure... Cilli is a fairly
    approachable western european province for capital.
- Teutonic/Livonian/Riga (ezpz)
  - Consider prepping a flip to Prussian for later HRE reform acceptance
- Austria
  - Maybe...............................................

Eastern wars:
- Ming
  - worst case humiliate them on first war, but pref humiliate Uzbek as
    secondary participant if alliance chains work out
  - usual Ming bank -- can be done three times
- Various Manchurian tribes
  - order shouldn't matter, but it would be nice to accept Jurchen culture for
    later Manchu flip + faster coring before going too ham.
- Korea
  - PAIN. I think 2 diprep is unnecessary. Maybe not worth truce breaking them.

Caucasia:
Eat ortho provinces. Also eat Shia provinces for some trickery later.

Savescum for:
1) Poland Lithuania PU (they should be separate)
2) Moldavia vassal (they should remain independent and therefore guaranteed by Poland)
3) Crimea Ottoman march (no thanks)
4) Austria Hungary PU
5) Pulse events (see notes).
